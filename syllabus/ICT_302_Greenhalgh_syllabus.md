# Course Information

## Course Description

The course focuses on the practice and theory of designing, building and maintaining content management systems.

## Prerequisites

None

## Course Objectives—"I Can" Statements

The following “I can” statements will serve as guiding objectives for this course. By the end of the semester, you should feel comfortable making each statement about yourself and be able to back up that statement with your performance on course activities and assessments.

- I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
- I can manage content using established workflows.
- I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
- I can find and use resources for self-directed learning
- I can describe and compare content management systems.

## Required Course Materials

You are not required to buy a textbook for this class.

Over the course of the semester, however, you will be learning about a number of free resources that you can use to learn about content management systems, and you will work together as a class to use what you learn from those resources (and other course activities) to write a content management systems guidebook that you can use as a reminder and reference after the semester has ended.

# Course Assessments

## Assessment Submission Policies

All assessments will be submitted through Canvas; however, the details of **what** will be submitted varies from assessment to assessment. This includes the possibility that you will need to submit multiple documents for a single assessment. Please pay close attention to the *Assessment Details* section so that you know what you need to submit for a particular submission.

Officially, assessments are due at 11:59pm on the date listed in the syllabus below. Practically speaking, however, I will grade without penalty any assessment that is turned in by the time I begin looking over that assessment. However, I will not grade or provide feedback on any work that is completed after this time unless you have made other arrangements with me. Naturally, because my schedule varies from week to week and because I try to provide feedback as quickly as possible, your best bet is to turn in your work by the official deadline or—if life has thrown you a curveball—to get in touch with me ahead of time to make other arrangements.

## Assessment Details

### Self-Evaluation (40 points; due 15 December 2019)

At the end of the semester, you will evaluate your own learning and performance in the class—including your contributions to the CMS Guidebook (see below). You will download [the Markdown template](https://github.com/greenhas/ICT_302_2019_Fall/blob/master/assessments/self-evaluation_template.md) in the [assessments folder](https://github.com/greenhas/ICT_302_2019_Fall/blob/master/assessments/) of my class repository, copy the template, and follow the prompts to evaluate your performance in the class. You will then upload the Markdown file to Canvas. In most cases, the grade you give yourself is the grade you will receive; however, if there are clear abuses of the privilege of self-assessment, I will adjust your grade to one that is more appropriate.

### CMS Guidebook Assessments

Many of the points in this class will come from your work with your classmates to compose a CMS Guidebook where you will document key concepts, practical tips, and other information that you learn during the semester so that you can use it as a reference in future professional settings. Your work on the CMS Guidebook will be evaluated in the following ways:

#### Mid-Semester Written Agreement (4 points, due 20 October 2019)

By the midpoint of the semester, you and your classmates should have had enough time to decide how each member of the class will contribute to the book. You will copy [the Markdown template](https://github.com/greenhas/ICT_302_2019_Fall/blob/master/assessments/CMS%20Guidebook%20Assessments/Written%20Agreements/written_agreement_template.md) in the [Written Agreements folder](https://github.com/greenhas/ICT_302_2019_Fall/blob/master/assessments/CMS%20Guidebook%20Assessments/Written%20Agreements) of my class repository and follow the prompts to describe your commitment to how you will contribute to the book. You will then make a pull request that adds the copied and modified template to the Written Agreements folder. Then, you will link to your file as a Canvas submission. You will be graded based on the guidelines listed in the template.

#### Revised Written Agreement (2 points, due 26 November 2019)

Expectations change over the course of the semester, so you will have a chance to revisit your written agreement to ensure that it accurately reflects your commitments to the course. You will make a pull request for your Written Agreement in the [Written Agreements folder](https://github.com/greenhas/ICT_302_2019_Fall/blob/master/assessments/CMS%20Guidebook%20Assessments/Written%20Agreements) folder of my class repository that 1) makes appropriate changes to your written agreement (or specifies that you are not making any changes) and 2) adds a justification for those changes to the bottom of your agreement. You will then link to your file as a Canvas submission. You will earn 1 point for making changes (or making it clear that you aren't making changes) and another point for providing an adequate justification for those changes.

#### Colleague Evaluation (8 points; due 15 December 2019)

At the end of the semester, a colleague whom you have identified in your Written Agreement will evaluate your contributions to the CMS Guidebook, using the terms set out in your Written Agreement as a guide. They will download your Written Agreement from the [Written Agreements folder](https://github.com/greenhas/ICT_302_2019_Fall/blob/master/assessments/CMS%20Guidebook%20Assessments/Written%20Agreements) and make a copy of the document. Under your comments in the **How Will It Be Evaluated?** section, they will give you a score out of eight, using specific evidence from your contributions to the CMS Guidebook and its workflows and specific passages from your Written Agreement to justify that score. They will then email me their evaluation (along with any other evaluations they are completing) at [spencer.greenhalgh@uky.edu](mailto:spencer.greenhalgh@uky.edu). In most cases, the grade they give you is the grade you will receive; however, if there are clear abuses of the important process of peer-assessment, I will adjust your grade to one that is more appropriate.

#### Dr. Greenhalgh Evaluation (6 points; completed after 15 December 2019)

Throughout the semester, I will use personal conversations and our class tools and technologies to provide feedback on the progress of the CMS Guidebook and suggest areas for improvement. At the end of the semester, I will give the CMS Guidebook a score out of six based on how well it reflects course concepts and responds to my feedback throughout the semester.
