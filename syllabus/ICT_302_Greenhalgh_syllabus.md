# Course Information

## Course Description

The course focuses on the practice and theory of designing, building and maintaining content management systems.

## Prerequisites

None.

## Course Objectives—"I Can" Statements

The following “I can” statements will serve as guiding objectives for this course. By the end of the semester, you should feel comfortable making each statement about yourself and be able to back up that statement with your performance on course activities and assessments.

- I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
- I can manage content using established workflows.
- I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
- I can find and use resources for self-directed learning
- I can describe and compare content management systems.

## Required Course Materials

You are not required to buy a textbook for this class.

Over the course of the semester, however, you will be learning about a number of free resources that you can use to learn about content management systems, and you will work together as a class to use what you learn from those resources (and other course activities) to write a content management systems guidebook that you can use as a reminder and reference after the semester has ended.

# Course Assessments

## Assessment Scale
- A: 90 - 100
- B: 80 - 89.99
- C: 70 - 79.99
- D: 60 - 69.99
- E: 0 - 59.99

I do not "round up" grades at the end of the semester. I know that can be frustrating for someone who is "almost there," but all rounding really does is move the "almost there" zone down by half a point, potentially creating another group of students who are frustrated that they just barely missed the mark. If you are concerned about potentially being right on the edge of a grading category at the end of the semester, the best thing to do is to talk to me about your concerns as early as possible (and certainly not after the fact) so that we can make sure that you wind up where you want to be!

## Assessment Overview

Your final grade for this class is based on 100 points, which you will earn by completing the following assessments:

- **Self-Evaluation** (40 points)
- **CMS Guidebook** (total of 20 points)
	- Mid-Semester Written Agreement (4 points)
	- Revised Written Agreement (2 points)
	- Colleague Evaluation (8 points)

	- Hugo Report (2 points)
	- Content Management System Comparison (2 points)
	- Modeling, Aggregation, and Presentation Comparison (2 points)



## Assessment Submission Policies

All assessments will be submitted through Canvas; however, the details of **what** will be submitted varies from assessment to assessment. This includes the possibility that you will need to submit multiple documents for a single assessment. Please pay close attention to the *Assessment Details* section so that you know what you need to submit for a particular submission.

Officially, assessments are due at 11:59pm on the dates listed below. Practically speaking, however, I will grade without penalty any assessment that is turned in by the time I begin looking over that assessment. However, I will not grade or provide feedback on any work that is completed after this time unless you have made other arrangements with me. Naturally, because my schedule varies from week to week and because I try to provide feedback as quickly as possible, your best bet is to turn in your work by the official deadline or—if life has thrown you a curveball—to get in touch with me ahead of time to make other arrangements.

## Assessment Details

### Self-Evaluation (40 points; due 15 December 2019)

At the end of the semester, you will evaluate your own learning and performance in the class—including your contributions to the CMS Guidebook (see below). You will download [the Markdown template](https://github.com/greenhas/ICT_302_2019_Fall/blob/master/assessments/self-evaluation_template.md) in the [assessments folder](https://github.com/greenhas/ICT_302_2019_Fall/blob/master/assessments/) of my class repository, copy the template, and follow the prompts to evaluate your performance in the class. You will then add the Markdown file to your personal GitHub repository and link to the file as a Canvas submission. In most cases, the grade you give yourself is the grade you will receive; however, if there are clear abuses of the privilege of self-assessment, I will adjust your grade to one that is more appropriate.

### CMS Guidebook Assessments

Many of the points in this class will come from your work with your classmates to compose a CMS Guidebook where you will document key concepts, practical tips, and other information that you learn during the semester so that you can use it as a reference in future professional settings. Your work on the CMS Guidebook will be evaluated in the following ways:

#### Mid-Semester Written Agreement (4 points, due 20 October 2019)

By the midpoint of the semester, you and your classmates should have had enough time to decide how each member of the class will contribute to the book. You will copy [the Markdown template](https://github.com/greenhas/ICT_302_2019_Fall/blob/master/assessments/CMS%20Guidebook%20Assessments/Written%20Agreements/written_agreement_template.md) in the [Written Agreements folder](https://github.com/greenhas/ICT_302_2019_Fall/blob/master/assessments/CMS%20Guidebook%20Assessments/Written%20Agreements) of my class repository and follow the prompts to describe your commitment to how you will contribute to the book. You will then make a pull request that adds the copied and modified template to my Written Agreements folder. Then, you will link to your file as a Canvas submission. You will be graded based on the guidelines listed in the template.

#### Revised Written Agreement (2 points, due 1 December 2019)

Expectations change over the course of the semester, so you will have a chance to revisit your Written Agreement to ensure that it accurately reflects your commitments to the course. You will make a pull request for your Written Agreement in the [Written Agreements folder](https://github.com/greenhas/ICT_302_2019_Fall/blob/master/assessments/CMS%20Guidebook%20Assessments/Written%20Agreements) of my class repository that 1) makes appropriate changes to your written agreement (or specifies that you are not making any changes) and 2) adds a justification for those changes to the bottom of your agreement. You will then link to your file as a Canvas submission. You will earn 1 point for making changes (or making it clear that you aren't making changes) and another point for providing an adequate justification for those changes.

#### Colleague Evaluation (8 points; due 15 December 2019)

At the end of the semester, a colleague whom you have identified in your Written Agreement will evaluate your contributions to the CMS Guidebook, using the terms set out in your Written Agreement as a guide. They will download your Written Agreement from the [Written Agreements folder](https://github.com/greenhas/ICT_302_2019_Fall/blob/master/assessments/CMS%20Guidebook%20Assessments/Written%20Agreements) and make a copy of the document. Under your comments in the **How Will It Be Evaluated?** section, they will give you a score out of eight, using specific evidence from your contributions to the CMS Guidebook and its workflows and specific passages from your Written Agreement to justify that score. They will add that file to their personal GitHub repository and email me a link to the file (and any other evaluations) at [spencer.greenhalgh@uky.edu](mailto:spencer.greenhalgh@uky.edu). In most cases, the grade they give you is the grade you will receive; however, if there are clear abuses of the important process of peer-assessment, I will adjust your grade to one that is more appropriate.

#### Dr. Greenhalgh Evaluation (6 points; completed after 15 December 2019)

Throughout the semester, I will use personal conversations and our class tools and technologies to provide feedback on the progress of the CMS Guidebook and suggest areas for improvement. At the end of the semester, I will give the CMS Guidebook a score out of six based on how well it reflects course concepts and responds to my feedback throughout the semester. **This same score will be entered for everyone in the class.**

### Learning Journal Assessments

A large portion of your final grade comes from the learning journal that you will keep throughout the semester. Every week (except Week 14), you will push (at least) two new entries to the `learning_journal` Markdown file that you will create in your personal GitHub repository as part of your first Proof of Concept assessment. In each entry, you will describe in detail something that you have learned and that you want to remember, whether because it was really interesting, because you want to make sure it winds up in the CMS Guidebook, or because you think it will help you later in the course. What you learned can come from a class lecture, an exploration activity, a creation activity, an outside resource that you found, or anything else—so long as it is related to Content Management Systems.

Your learning journal will be a wonderful resource for you if fully embraced. You can use it as a personal reference for after the class is over, as a "staging area" for concepts and ideas that you think should go into the CMS Guidebook, and as a chance to solidify your learning by explaining what you learn in your own words. There are no rules for how much or how little to write, and there are no standardized guidelines for formatting (except that you include a date for each new entry to make the separation between them clear)—please use this assignment as an opportunity to go above and beyond!

That said, grading is (as always) a necessary bummer. Each week, you will submit a link to your up-to-date learning journal as a Canvas submission. Each entry will receive half a point simply for being completed and an additional half-point for being specific and detailed.

### "Proof of Concept" Assessments

Most of the technical and conceptual skills that you pick up will be demonstrated in your self-evaluation, the CMS Guidebook, and your Learning Journal; however, there are some skills you should pick up in this class that don't fit nicely into those assessments. These "Proof of Concept" assessments will give you practical ways of demonstrating your understanding of these skills.

#### Learning Journal Setup (2 points; due 1 September 2019)

Create your own repository in GitHub, set it to private, and add me (username: [greenhas](https://github.com/greenhas)) as a collaborator. Create a Markdown file in your repository that is titled `learning_journal` and that includes an introduction and your first two entries, you will then link to the file as a Canvas submission. You may organize your learning journal however you like, but you must use at least two different kinds of Markdown element. You will receive 1 point for creating the repository, setting it to private, and adding me as a collaborator. You will receive another point for writing an introduction to your learning journal and using at least two different kinds of Markdown elements in your journal.

#### Introductory Web Page (2 points; due 8 September 2019)

Use GitHub Pages to create a simple web page that introduces you to the rest of the class. Include a picture that says something about you (it doesn't need to be you if you're concerned about privacy), and share enough information that we can get to know you some (but remember that your GitHub Page will be public). Use at least two HTML elements and include at least two CSS stylings. Link to the page as a Canvas submission. You will receive 1 point for for creating a web page that includes a picture and an introduction, and 1 point for using at least two HTML elements and including at least two CSS stylings.

#### Hugo Tinkering Report (2 points; due 29 September 2019)

Copy [the Markdown template](https://github.com/greenhas/ICT_302_2019_Fall/blob/master/assessments/Proofs%20of%20Concept/Hugo_Tinkering_Report_template.md) in the [Proofs of Concept](https://github.com/greenhas/ICT_302_2019_Fall/blob/master/assessments/Proofs%20of%20Concept/) of my class repository and add it to your personal repository. Follow the prompts in the template to describe your experience tinkering with Hugo and how it helped you connect with the class concepts that we've discussed so far. Link to the page as a Canvas submission. You will be graded according to the guidelines in the template.

#### Content Management System Comparison (2 points; due 20 October 2019)

Using guidelines presented in class, identify and explore a content management system other than Hugo and WordPress. This exploration should be as detailed as possible, including setting up a free, trial, or local version of the CMS and tinkering with content and presentation. Then, copy [the Markdown template](https://github.com/greenhas/ICT_302_2019_Fall/blob/master/assessments/Proofs%20of%20Concept/Content_Management_System_Comparison_template.md) in the [Proofs of Concept](https://github.com/greenhas/ICT_302_2019_Fall/blob/master/assessments/Proofs%20of%20Concept/) of my class repository and add it to your personal repository. Follow the prompts in the template to compare Hugo, WordPress, and the CMS that you have chosen, using concepts and terms that we've discussed in class. Link to the page as a Canvas submission. You will be graded according to the guidelines in the template.

#### Modeling, Aggregation, and Presentation Comparison (2 points; due 10 November 2019)

Using guidelines presented in class, identify and explore three different websites that you believe use the same CMS. This exploration should be as detailed as possible, exploring as much content as you can. Then, copy [the Markdown template](https://github.com/greenhas/ICT_302_2019_Fall/blob/master/assessments/Proofs%20of%20Concept/Modeling_Aggregation_Presentation_Comparison_template.md) in the [Proofs of Concept](https://github.com/greenhas/ICT_302_2019_Fall/blob/master/assessments/Proofs%20of%20Concept/) of my class repository and add it to your personal repository. Follow the prompts in the template to compare the three websites that you have chosen, using concepts and terms that we've discussed in class. Link to the page as a Canvas submission. You will be graded according to the guidelines in the template.
