# Course Information

## Course Description

The course focuses on the practice and theory of designing, building and maintaining content management systems.

## Prerequisites

None

## Course Objectives—"I Can" Statements

The following “I can” statements will serve as guiding objectives for this course. By the end of the semester, you should feel comfortable making each statement about yourself and be able to back up that statement with your performance on course activities and assessments.

- I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
- I can manage content using established workflows.
- I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
- I can find and use resources for self-directed learning
- I can describe and compare content management systems.

## Required Course Materials

You are not required to buy a textbook for this class.

Over the course of the semester, however, you will be learning about a number of free resources that you can use to learn about content management systems, and you will work together as a class to use what you learn from those resources (and other course activities) to write a content management systems guidebook that you can use as a reminder and reference after the semester has ended.
